# **Winds of Fury** 
## Team 13 Game Design Document

### November 17, 2024
Logan and Param joined a call at around 5:00 PM to brainstorm ideas for our game. We explored several concepts, including a physics-based human simulator similar to Surgeon Simulator, a free-fall obstacle-dodging game, a racing simulator, and a submarine simulator. Ultimately, we settled on creating a hot air balloon simulator, factoring in elements like wind, gravity, fuel management, and various obstacles.

To organize our thoughts and streamline the planning process, Param set up a Miro board where we could visually lay out our ideas and concepts. This helped us clarify our direction and refine the core mechanics of the game.

**Objective Statement:** The objective of our game is to navigate a hot air balloon through dynamic environments, skillfully managing wind currents, fuel, and obstacles to reach your destination safely.
