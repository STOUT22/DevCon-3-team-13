# **Winds of Fury** 
## Team 13 Game Design Document

### November 17, 2024
Logan and Param joined a call at around 5:00 PM to brainstorm ideas for our game. We explored several concepts, including a physics-based human simulator similar to Surgeon Simulator, a free-fall obstacle-dodging game, a racing simulator, and a submarine simulator. Ultimately, we settled on creating a hot air balloon simulator, factoring in elements like wind, gravity, fuel management, and various obstacles.

To organize our thoughts and streamline the planning process, Param set up a Miro board where we could visually lay out our ideas and concepts. This helped us clarify our direction and refine the core mechanics of the game.

**Objective Statement:** The objective of our game is to navigate a hot air balloon through dynamic environments, skillfully managing wind currents, fuel, and obstacles to reach your destination safely.

##### Tasks for week 1

### Game Mechanics
To ensure a realistic and engaging hot air balloon simulation, we need to factor in the following elements:

1. **Gravity**

- Constant downward force requiring players to manage altitude effectively.
- Increased fuel usage when counteracting gravity.
2. **Wind**

- Horizontal forces pushing the balloon in various directions.
- Randomized gusts and directional shifts as difficulty increases.
3. **Pressure and Altitude**

- Lower atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes reduces lift capacity.
- Adjustments in fuel consumption based on altitude changes.
4. **Fuel Management**

- Limited fuel requires strategic use to maintain altitude and direction.
- Opportunities to refuel at checkpoints or during specific scenarios.
5. **Temperature**

- Colder air at higher altitudes or in certain environments affects balloon lift.
- Temperature-based hazards like ice formation.
6. **Obstacles**

- Physical obstacles such as buildings, mountains, or trees.
 - Environmental hazards like birds, storms, and lightning.
